## ⚙️ Technology

-   **Streamlit** - Web interface
-   **Gemini AI** - Content generation and analysis
-   **PyPDF2** - PDF text extraction
-   **Markdown-to-PDF** - Document formatting
-   **Code Execution Engine** - Safe code testing

## 🛡️ Security Note

Don't worry - your code runs in an isolated environment. We're not stealing your revolutionary approach to printing "Hello World" or calculating Fibonacci sequences.
